# Welcome!

This repository contains a set of convenience shell scripts to be used in conjunction with a Mitsumi module,
Broadcom 4330 WiFi+BLE chip, a Freescale i.MX280 ARM9, a Linux 3.16 Kernel, with the brcmfmac kernel driver,
and a custom user-space `wl` tool provided by Mitsumi.

The scripts will activate and turn on the test mode commands. You will need the proprietary docs from your
vendor but here is "folklore circulated" set of commands for activating packet transmission or reception for
regulatory testing.

Only use these as a reference (I slogged through this), you should definitely be double checking anything you have to do for FCC testing with your vendor.
